-- The following code is not valid SQL and appears to be Python code.
-- SQL files should contain SQL statements. If you need to hash passwords in SQL,
-- you should use a database function or preprocess the data in your application.

-- Example of a hashed password inserted into a SQL file:
INSERT INTO users (email, password) VALUES ('user@gmail.com', 'testpassword');
